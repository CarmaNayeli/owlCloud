   - Click the "Discord Integration" button in the RollCloud extension
   - Follow the invite link to add Pip Bot to your Discord server
   - Ensure the bot has necessary permissions for posting messages

2. **Generate Connection Code**:
   - In RollCloud extension, click "Setup Discord Integration"
   - The extension will generate a 6-character code (e.g., `ABC123`)
   - Copy this code

3. **Connect in Discord**:
   - In your Discord server, type `/rollcloud [your-code]`
   - Example: `/rollcloud ABC123`
   - The bot will confirm the connection

4. **Verify Connection**:

## 🧪 Experimental Build - Two-Way Sync

### Overview
The experimental build contains two-way synchronization code that allows changes made in Roll20 to update DiceCloud character sheets using Meteor's DDP protocol.

### Current Implementation Status

#### ✅ What's Implemented
- **Meteor DDP Client**: Complete WebSocket client for DiceCloud communication
- **Build System**: Experimental builds compile with `npm run build:exp`
- **HP Sync Logic**: Property cache system to identify correct Hit Points fields
- **Documentation**: Implementation guides and technical documentation

#### ⚠️ Current Limitations
- **Integration Gap**: Experimental files are copied during build but not integrated into main extension code
- **Manual Testing**: Requires manual file copying and extension reloading
- **Limited Scope**: Only Hit Points sync is partially implemented
- **No UI Controls**: No settings toggle to enable/disable sync

### Building and Testing

#### Build Commands
```bash
# Standard build (stable)
npm run build

# Experimental build with two-way sync
npm run build:exp
# or
npm run build:experimental
```

#### Installation
1. Build experimental version: `npm run build:exp`
2. Load in browser:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` → Load unpacked → `dist-experimental/chrome/`
   - Firefox: `about:debugging` → Load Temporary Add-on → `dist-experimental/firefox/manifest.json`

#### Testing Process
1. Use test characters, not main campaign characters
2. Backup DiceCloud data before testing
3. Monitor browser console for `[DDP]` and `[Sync]` messages
4. Verify property updates in DiceCloud after Roll20 changes

## Troubleshooting

### Character Import Issues
- **"Not logged in to DiceCloud"**: Click extension icon and login again
- **"API token expired"**: Your session expired; login again via the popup
- **"Not on a character page"**: Navigate to a DiceCloud character sheet
- **Fields not populating in Roll20**: Try Shift+Click for field debug mode

### Roll20 Chat Issues
- **Rolls not appearing**: Ensure Roll20 tab is open and chat is visible
- **Wrong character speaking**: Re-import character data to update name
- **Template errors**: Using a custom Roll20 sheet? May need template customization

### Character Sheet Overlay Issues
1. **Sheet Won't Open**:
   - Check that you've imported character data first
   - Look for the "📋 Character Sheet" button in bottom-right of Roll20
   - Try using the extension popup to open the sheet
   - Check browser console (`F12`) for error messages

2. **Rolls Not Posting**:
   - Ensure Roll20 chat is visible and not minimized
   - Check that you're logged into Roll20
   - Verify character name is set in the imported data
   - Try refreshing the Roll20 page

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify you're on the correct Dice Cloud/Roll20 pages
3. Try clearing the extension data and re-extracting
4. Open an issue on GitHub with details about your problem
5. **If all else fails, message me on Discord @Carmabella - I'm a solo dev and I'll help you out!**
