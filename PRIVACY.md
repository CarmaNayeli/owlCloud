*Last updated: January 19, 2026*

## Data Collection

RollCloud does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All data handling occurs locally in your browser.

## Data Usage

- **DiceCloud Access**: The extension fetches your character data from DiceCloud v2 (dicecloud.com) using your existing login session. This data is stored locally in your browser.
- **Roll20 Integration**: Actions and rolls are posted directly to Roll20 (roll20.net) chat using your active session.
- **Local Storage**: Character data and preferences are stored locally in your browser using the browser's local storage API and are never transmitted to third parties. This includes character stats, resources, HP changes, and other modifications you make during gameplay.

## Third-Party Services

RollCloud interacts with:
- DiceCloud v2 (dicecloud.com) - to retrieve character information
- Roll20 (roll20.net) - to post game actions

These services have their own privacy policies which govern their data handling.

## Data Security
