# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create your own icons using:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Online icon generators
- Design tools like Figma or Canva

## Design Suggestions

The icon should represent the bridge between Dice Cloud and Roll20:
- Consider using dice imagery (d20, d6, etc.)
- Cloud symbols to represent Dice Cloud
- Arrows or transfer symbols to show data import
- Roll20's characteristic red color scheme

## Temporary Solution

Until you add custom icons, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use existing D&D-themed icons from free icon packs
3. Generate icons using online tools like favicon.io

The extension will work without icons, but they won't display properly in the browser toolbar.
